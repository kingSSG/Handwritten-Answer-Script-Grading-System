# Handwritten-Answer-Script-Grading-System
automated grading system for handwritten answer scripts, aimed
at reducing subjectivity and enhancing efficiency. The system employs Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to convert handwritten text into digital format. Subse- quently, spelling
errors are identified and corrected to ensure accurate semantic analysis. The corrected text is
semantically matched with a pre-stored answer key using similar- ity algorithms. Grading is
then assigned based on the number of spelling errors and the semantic alignment with the
model answer
