# 📝 Handwritten Answer Grading System using OCR and AI

This project automates the grading of handwritten answers using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and AI techniques to ensure faster, more consistent, and less biased evaluation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Upload handwritten answer images.
- 🔍 Extract text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
- 🧠 AI-based error correction for OCR mistakes.
- ✍️ Spelling and grammar checking with semantic understanding.
- 📊 Automated grading of the answer based on correctness and relevance.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Image Upload**  
   Users upload a photo/scan of the handwritten answer script.

2. **OCR Processing**  
   The image is processed using an OCR engine to extract raw text.

3. **AI Text Correction**  
   A sequence-to-sequence model (or other NLP technique) is used to clean and correct OCR errors.

4. **Grammatical Analysis**  
   Tools like language models and grammar correction APIs analyze the structure and semantics.

5. **Scoring System**  
   A scoring algorithm compares the cleaned text with model answers and assigns marks accordingly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Tesseract OCR / EasyOCR  
- Seq2Seq / Transformer models (for correction)  
- NLTK / spaCy / LanguageTool (for grammar)  
- Flask / Streamlit (for frontend, if applicable)

## 📦 Dataset

You can use publicly available datasets like:
- IAM Handwriting Database (for initial testing)
- Custom datasets with scanned handwritten answers (recommended for domain adaptation)

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- School & University exams
- Online assessments
- Competitive test evaluations
- Reducing teacher workload in large classrooms
